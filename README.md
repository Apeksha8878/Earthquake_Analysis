Earthquake & Tsunami Analysis (2001–2022) 
🔎Project Summary: This project focuses on analyzing global earthquake records from 2001 to 2022 to understand patterns in their magnitude, depth, and tsunami connections. Using Python, statistical summaries and visualizations were created to observe how earthquakes behave over time and what factors increase the likelihood of tsunamis. The study also draws attention to large earthquakes (magnitude ≥ 8.0) and their common characteristics such as location and depth.

📊Key Insights (Simplified Explanations) 1.Stable Magnitude Trend:Over the 22-year period, the overall strength of earthquakes has not changed much. The average earthquake size stayed roughly between 6.8 and 7.1, showing that global seismic activity remains relatively steady every year.

2.Shallow Earthquakes Are Common Most earthquakes occur at shallow depths (below 300 km). Shallow quakes are generally more damaging because they happen close to the Earth's surface, where the shaking is felt more strongly.

3.Tsunami-Generating Earthquakes that produce tsunamis are usually stronger in magnitude and occur near the ocean floor. Their shallow position under the seabed helps displace large volumes of water, which leads to tsunami formation.

4.Major Earthquakes(≥8.0):Very powerful earthquakes (8.0 or more) are rare but have massive impacts.
